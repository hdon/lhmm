THERE IS NO DESIGN! NONE AT ALL!

100x100 grid
starting with single mageman per player
hashwords can
    summon blocks
    attack
    heal you
    other stuff?
blocks should be mana colored
take most damage from opposing mana on the mana wheel (2d mana circle thingy, hue-based)
mana depletion?
affinity
word overuse
scramblewords

need to decide if magemen can walk through lego bricks or not, probably not
need to decide realtime / turn-based, probably realtime, with casting taking wordlength
    game_ticks, summoned blocks falling one block/game_tick, game_ticks being about 1 second 
    maybe longer

need dictionary reader
[quickly] sort /usr/share/dict/words or some similar file
toss out anything that isn't all lower (no proper attacks)
use binary + index search methods to look trhough the dictionary
store indices of at least first single letters

need rendering system
simple mana plane, dim, rendered all with legotex
lego blocks, tops in legotex
manamen (for now just blocks floating in midair with shadow underneath)

need input system
hack up oglconsole?
at least borrow it for font drawing most likely

need network system
save for later, hotseat play for now (testing only) or just dummy opponent / no opponent
design for network transparency from start

need spell classes / effects, summon info, etc.
see SPELLS file

need sleep for now, or at least should.
